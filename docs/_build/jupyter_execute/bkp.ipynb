    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "RSOME (Robust Stochastic Optimization Made Easy) is an open-source Python package for modeling generic optimization problems. Models in RSOME are constructed by variables, constraints, and expressions that are formatted as N-dimensional arrays. These arrays are consistent with the NumPy library in terms of syntax and operations, including broadcasting, indexing, slicing, element-wise operations, and matrix calculation rules, among others. It provides a convenient platform to facilitate developments of optimization models and their applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "The RSOME package can be installed with the `pip` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install rsome\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of RSOME supports deterministic, robust optimization and distributionally robust optimization problems. In the default configuration, RSOME relies on open-source solvers imported from the `scipy.optimize` package to solve linear programming (`linprog()`) and mixed-integer linear programming (`milp()`) problems. Besides the default linear optimization solver, RSOME also provides modeling tools and interfaces for other open-source and commercial solvers that are capable of addressing more complicated optimization formats, such as second-order cone programming (SOCP), exponential cone programming (ECP), and semidefinite programming (SDP). Detailed information of all solver interfaces is presented in the following table.\n",

The optimal solution and the corresponding objective value can be attained by the `get()` method."
