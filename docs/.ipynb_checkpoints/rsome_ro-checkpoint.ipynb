    "## General Framework for Robust Optimization Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rsome.ro` module within RSOME is specifically crafted for robust optimization problems. This module features specialized modeling tools that enable the specification of random variables, uncertainty sets, and objective functions or constraints, accounting for worst-case realizations stemming from the uncertainty set. Let $\\pmb{z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^J$ represent a vector of random variables, $\\pmb{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I_x}$ denote the here-and-now decision made before the uncertainty unfolds, and $\\pmb{y}(\\pmb{z})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I_y}$ signify the wait-and-see decision made afterwards. Models supported by the `ro` module can be expressed in the following general format:\n",

    "The wait-and-see decision $\\pmb{y}$ potentially representing an arbitrary functional dependence on the uncertainty realization $\\pmb{z}$, is inherently infinite-dimensional, posing challenges for optimization. To enhance tractability, a prevalent technique in robust optimization is the adoption of a linear decision rule (or affine decision rule).

    "Affine expressions of decision rules or expressions involving random variables can also be evaluated as similar callable functions. The only difference is that values of such expressions are also affected by the realized values of random variables, so we may need to specify the realizations of random variables in calling these functions. For example, the optimal decision rule y in the model above can be written as $y=z + 2.5$, its value under $z=0.5$ is evaluated using the following code,"
